## [product risks](https://svpg.com/four-big-risks/)
### 4 risks
#### value risk
- whether customers will buy it or users will choose to use it
#### usability risk
- whether users can figure out how to use it
#### feasibility risk
- whether our engineers can build what we need with the time, skills and technology we have
#### business viability risk
- whether this solution also works for the various aspects of our business
### tackle risks
- Tackle the big risks early – especially value risk and business risk
- Figure out solutions collaboratively – engineering, design, and product, working side-by-side
- Focus on solving problems – it’s not about features or a roadmap; it’s about delivering results

## missionaries versus mercenaries
- what's the problems we're trying to solve versus just get this built by this date
- Steve Jobs used to say, we don't hire all these smart people to tell them what to do we hire these people, so they can show us what's possible
- feeling real ownership over something, and just feeling like an employee

## dependencies
### you will always have dependencies.
- The question is, are you minimizing those dependencies?
- Netflix likes to have the mantra, we need teams that are highly aligned, but loosely coupled
- having a small number of platform dependencies is way more empowering
- And also, you're able to innovate much more because you have a much higher level of abstraction to work with, then in the idea of an image of a quote, full stack, totally autonomous team that has all the skills they need going all the way down, but they can hardly do anything. Because their scope is so narrow.
